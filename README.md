# Cricket-Analysis

This software is designed for cricket coaches to analyse players.
You can export your data as a CSV file which you can import in Excel or Google Sheets.
Remember to delete all the contents of the file except for the header. If you accidentally delete the header, you can find a blank CSV file including headers in this repository.

You must have Python 3 installed to run this program. Once you have installed Python, run main.py, either from within IDLE or from the file explorer.
